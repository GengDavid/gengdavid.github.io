## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, supervised by Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Ling Chen
](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). I received my bachelor's degree in School of Data and Computer Science (currently School of Computer Science and Engineering) from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019. In 2019 - 2020, I spent a wonderful year working with Prof. [Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) at Sun Yat-Sen University as a research assistant.  
My current research interests are in Computer Vision and improving vision models with advanced Machine Learning algorithms, such as Automated Machine Learning, Few-shot Learning  and Continual Learning. Specifically, I have recently worked in:
- Computer Vision: Object detection, Segmentation and Human pose estimation
- Machine Learning: Self-supervised pre-training, Continual learning, Few-shot learning, Weakly-supervised learning and Automated machine learning.


## News
[2021.12] One paper "Few-Shot Segmentation via Cycle-Consistent Transformer" is accepted by NeurIPS 2021 and the code is available [here](https://github.com/YanFangCS/CyCTR-Pytorch).
