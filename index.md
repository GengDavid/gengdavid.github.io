I received my bachelor degree in School of Data and Computer Science (currently School of Computer Science and Engineering) from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019. In 2019 - 2020, I spent a wonderful year working with Prof. (Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) at Sun Yat-Sen University as a research assistent. My current research interests are in Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms for Computer Vision.
